<p> This <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonas.groschwitz7889/viz/DialectsinGermany/inGermany">interactive visualization</a> shows the data of the <a href="https://dsa.info/regionalakzente/">REDE "Regionalakzente in Deutschland"</a> survey. The survey recorded deviations from standard German pronounciation by speakers across Germany. In other words, the survey describes the landscape of German dialects through a collection of over 5000 datapoints. Each datapoint describes:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 20px">
 <li>the city or town where the sound was observed,</li>
 <li>the standard German pronunciation of the sound (<i>standard reference</i>),</li>
 <li>how it was pronounced by the local speaker (<i>regional realization</i>),</li>
 <li>and optionally some example words where the sound occurs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my visualization, I create maps that focus on one sound in standard German and display that sound's regional variation. For example, the figure on the right shows the regional pronunciations of <span class=ipa>/i/</span>, which is the so called <i>lax i</i> sound of German, used for short <i>i</i> sounds as in the German words "Wind" or "Kissen". All sounds such as <span class=ipa>/i/</span> are spelled here using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>. At each city for which the survey contains data for this sound, the map shows all recorded regional realizations in a pie chart. Similar regional sounds have similar colours (as explained below). Hovering over a segment of a pie chart shows the regional realization, city name and possible examples in a tooltip.</p>
<p>Note that in each pie chart, each datapoint has the same weight. That is, the width of a slice of the pie is simply determined by how often that regional realization was recorded in the survey. Due to the small sample size of the survey, the pie charts should therefore not be interpreted as representing the prevalence of certain sounds in the overall population. Rather, the pie charts simply visualize the survey data. Further, the survey only recorded <em>deviations</em> from the standard pronunciations. Therefore, there are an unkown amount of occurrences where the local speaker actually used the standard pronunciation. These occurrences were not recorded in the survey, and are therefore also not present in the visualization.</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Analysis</h2>
<p>Some of what we found about /lax i/, such as parallels to dutch, some things widespread while some are rare. Limitations found, e.g. missing data for /t/ in swabian dialects (check missing locations)</p>
<h2 id="research-interests">Improving the visualization using domain knowledge: choosing meaningful colours</h2>
<p>Choice of colors, grouping /t/ elisions.</p>
<h2 id="research-interests">For nerds: cleaning and preparing the data</h2>
<p>cleaning data, dealing with multiple sounds in one datapoint.</p>
<h2 id="research-interests">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Give a summary of the above</p>
