<p> In this analysis, I examine the different animals available in the zoo-themed board game Ark Nova using a linear regression model. The results are not only interesting for fans of the game, but also from a pure data analysis standpoint: for example, they reveal strengths and shortcomings of the linear regression approach. In most of the text, I will assume that the reader has no prior knowledge about Ark Nova, and explain things as we go. An exception are green boxes like this:</p>

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid green;">
<b>Game analysis:</b> In boxes like this, I will look at some of the results purely in terms of what they mean for the game, its balance and its strategy. Therefore, inside these boxes I will assume that the reader is already familiar with Ark Nova, and is here for the insights into the game. Feel free to skip the green boxes if that's not you!

<p>Ark Nova is a 2-4 player board game where players build a zoo, trying to both attract visitors and contribute to wildlife conservation efforts. Each player starts with an empty map of their zoo, and the core game mechanic is to build enclosures and place animals inside them. The animals come in the form of cards, like the ones seen on the right. You can find a list of all Ark Nova cards for example <a href="https://ssimeonoff.github.io/ark-nova">here</a> or <a href="https://arknova.cards/">here</a>.
</p>
<p> Each animal has a <i>cost</i>, shown in the gray square on the top right (17 for the cheetah, and 22 for the emu). Each card has a range of different features that are either requirements to playing the card or benefits when you add the animal to your zoo. For example, there is the <i>minimum enclosure size</i> that the animal requires (the brown hexagon in the top left; here both animals require an enclosure of size 5). Also, on the bottom right, each animal has an <i>attraction</i> value shown on a ticket-like shape, that represents how many visitors the animal will attract to your zoo (here 6 and 7, respectively). Many animals also have special abilities printed in text on the card. For example, the cheetah allows you to draw three more cards, and the emu allows you to build a special kind of enclosure for free.
<!--Then, each animal comes with some tags on the top right, for example the cheetah has two predator tags and one Africa tag. These tags are relevent for the wildlife conservation aspect of the game (which I won't go into detail here), but some animals also require you to have certain tags before you can add that animal to your zoo. For example, the emu card shows two requires you to allready have two-->

<p> This is a very brief introduction -- I skipped over some features of the animal cards, and the game has several more mechanics going beyond adding animals to your zoo, giving it incredible complexity. But for the analysis that follows, you will only need to know these basic concepts.

<h2 id="linear-regression">Modeling Animal Cost with Linear Regression</h2>
<p>While playing the game, I was asking myself: what makes up the cost of an animal? How do each of its properties contribute to its total price? Or in other words, if I add the cheetah to my zoo, how much am I paying for the three cards that I draw, and how much for the 6 attraction value? And, following that line of thought: offer some animals more value than others? Are some overpriced, some underpriced?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, I decided to build a <i>linear regression</i> model that predicts the price of an animal based on all its other features. The features of a card are its minimum enclosure size, attraction value, special abilities and so on. Each feature has a value associated with it, for example the cheetah's feature for its "Sprint" ability has value 3, because it allows you to draw 3 cards. For each feature \(x_i\), the linear regression model then has a parameter \(\beta_i\) that weights the impact of that feature. The model computes the price of an animal like this:
\[\text{cost}=x_1\beta_1 + x_2\beta_2 + \cdots + x_n\beta_n + \epsilon,\]
where \(\epsilon\) is another parameter of the model, that just offsets all costs by a fixed amount. Note that the feature values \(x_i\) are different for each animal, but the parameters \(\beta_i\) and \(\epsilon\) are the same for all animals. Note also that technically, every animal has every feature, but most of them have value 0 so they get ignored in the above calculation. For example, the Emu also has a feature for the "Sprint" ability, but it has value 0, because the Emu does not allow you to draw any cards. This choice of including features with value zero allows us to compute the cost for all animals in the same way, using the same model parameters.
</p>
<p>The nice thing about linear regression is that the resulting model is very interpretable: namely, its parameters answer my original question about how each of the features contribute to the total price. 
You simply multiply an animal's feature value with the corresponding model parameter, and that is how much the model thinks the
