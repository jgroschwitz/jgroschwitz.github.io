<blockquote>
<p> In this project seminar, my students each came up with a project to test the limits of ChatGPT in terms of processing abstract or complex forms of meaning. This included making ChatGPT solve logic puzzles, understand compact encodings of chess positions and play Wordle, as well as examining ChatGPTs gender bias. One fun teaching challenge here was explaining the inner workings of large language models like ChatGPT to non-AI logic students. Thanks to all the students for coming up with such fun projects, and doing such excellent work!

<p><strong>Class: Linear Algebra and Analysis</strong> (Part of the "Foundations of Mathematics" class, Saarland University, 2019/20)</p>
<blockquote>
<p> I taught the linear algebra and analysis sections of the larger Foundations of Mathematics class of the M.Sc. Language Science and Technology at Saarland University (unfortunately the class website seems to have been lost to time). This masters program is open to students with a background in mathematics, computer science or linguistics, and this class was essentially designed to bring the linguists up to speed with the math side of the program. I took a "flipped classroom" approach, where the sessions in the classroom consisted mostly of the students doing exercises and asking questions, and the subsequent discussions. For homework, I prepared reading materials and had the students watch some of the excellent videos of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown YouTube channel</a>. Having so much interaction in the classroom, and being able to often explain things to students in a one-on-one (or small group) setting while the other students worked was a fantastic experience.

<p><strong><a href="https://coli-saar.github.io/neural-math-19/">Seminar: The Mathematics of Deep Learning</a></strong> (Co-taught with Antoine Venant, Saarland University, 2019)</p>
<blockquote>
<p> In this seminar, we looked at recent research work involving a range of methods for neural machine learning aka deep learning (gradient descent, feed-forward and recurrent neural nets, attention, etc.), always coming back to the mathematical foundations in linear algebra and vector analysis. The goal was always to not only understand the big picture of the research results, but also develop a firm grasp of the mathematical tools and principles involved.

<p><strong><a href="https://coli-saar.github.io/gtg17/">Seminar: Grammars for Trees and Graphs</a></strong> (Co-taught with Meaghan Fowlie, Saarland University, 2018/19)</p>
<blockquote>
<p> In this seminar, we examined tree- and graph-shaped language representations for the syntax (surface structure) and semantics (meaning) of human language. In particular, our students presented research papers that focus on grammarformalisms that describe the relation between such trees (or graphs) and natural language texts. This ranged from linguistic theories (Minimalist Grammar) and computational theories (tree automata) to modern neuro-symbolic models that combine the idea of a grammar with deep learning methods.
